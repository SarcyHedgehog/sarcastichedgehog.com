            Wizard is a fantasy role-playing game developed by Progressive and published by Ariolasoft in 1984. Set in a magical world filled with mythical creatures and ancient mysteries, players embark on a quest to defeat the evil sorcerer and save the realm. With its immersive storytelling and expansive world, Wizard offers an unparalleled gaming experience.

            Players assume the role of a young wizard-in-training, tasked with mastering powerful spells, exploring dangerous dungeons, and recruiting allies to aid in their quest. With its open-ended gameplay and non-linear progression, Wizard provides players with the freedom to explore the world at their own pace and forge their own path to victory.
